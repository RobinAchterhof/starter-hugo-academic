As a researcher trained in clinical psychology, I am interested in what it means to be social, and how
being social relates to well-being. I am driven by the tackling of challenging research questions with
methodological rigour and transparency, and I enjoy the communication of my work to a broader
audience.
Within my current PhD project, I am primarily involved in the SIGMA project, a longitudinal cohort
study that is unique for its large-scale data collection in the daily lives of 1913 Flemish adolescents.
My specific aim in this project is to explore the relevant social processes in daily life as they relate to
parenting and psychopathology.
